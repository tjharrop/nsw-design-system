## Usage

Callouts are text excerpts, used as a visual cue to draw attention to content. 

Use callouts to: 
* call attention to important pieces of information
* supplement a point in the main text
* supply information that applies in special cases
* link to a relevant resource 

### When to avoid

Callouts should be used sparingly to maintain effectiveness, consider weaving the information into the introduction or as part of the instructions you're creating. 

Do not:
* add multiple callout boxes to a topic. This dilutes the importance of the callout and distracts the user. 
* create a callout with content that is not relevant to the user as your reader might then ignore furutre callouts

## How this component works

Callouts can contain an icon, a title and a message. Callouts should be short, easy to scan, informative and clear. 

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
