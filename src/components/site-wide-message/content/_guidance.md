## Usage

Global alerts:

* are designed to capture the attention of the user in a deliberately intrusive way
* persist over a session but are user dismissible
* are purposefully created and not initiated by a user interaction or system event

Use global alerts:

* to attract the attention of the user for important messages, or to encourage an action
* for messages or actions that are relevant to the entire product or system, not just a feature or page

Do:

* use clear, concise easy to understand language, to minimise cognitive load.
* use at the upper most part of the screen, before the masthead.
* reserve the use of the critical alert for circumstances which warrant it.

### Global alert states

Global alerts are styled according to their purpose:

* **Default alert** - used to convey non-critical important information
* **Critical alert** - used to convey critical information
* **Light alert** - used as an alternative to the blue default on sites where blue features prominently.

## When to avoid

Do not display in response to an action initiated by a user interaction or system event.
