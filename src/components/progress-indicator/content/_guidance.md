## Usage

Use a progress indicator to let a user know how far along they are in the current process. Using a progress indicator helps manage a user's expectation of the time and effort involved to complete a task and convey a sense of progression.

Do:
* test your content without a progress indicator to see if it is required by the user
* add where there is an evidence based user need to do so

### When to avoid

Do not use a progress indicator:
* when there are 2 or less steps in a process
* as navigation between steps
* when the exact number of steps may change

## How this component works

As a user progresses through the steps of a process, the **Step** position is updated and the progress bar highlights the correlating sections to reflect the steps completed. The **Step _ of _** text can be use on it own (without the progress bar) when this alone communicates enough information to the user. 

## Accessibility

All components are responsive and meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility guidelines.
